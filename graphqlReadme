GraphQL
Introduction to GraphQL
Powerful API Query Language: GraphQL is a query language for APIs, offering a flexible and efficient approach to interacting with data.
Developed by Facebook: Created internally in 2012 and released publicly in 2015.
Specify Exact Data Needs: Allows clients to request exactly what data they need, no more, no less.
Why Use GraphQL?
Efficient Data Retrieval: Minimizes over-fetching and under-fetching problems common in REST APIs.
Single API Endpoint: Uses a single endpoint to handle all actions, simplifying API design and usage.
Strongly Typed Schema: Facilitates tooling and validation, ensuring APIs only allow feasible operations.
Real-Time Capabilities: Supports real-time updates through subscriptions, pushing live data updates to clients.
Self-Documenting: APIs are self-documenting, allowing developers to query the API schema for documentation, which aids in development and maintenance.
Flexible and Evolutionary: Easily extendable, allowing developers to add new fields and types without impacting existing queries.
